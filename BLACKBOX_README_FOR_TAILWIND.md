# Tailwind Config File

This file is the configuration file for Tailwind CSS, a popular CSS framework. It allows you to customize the framework to your liking.

## Content

The `content` property tells Tailwind which files to scan for CSS classes. In this case, we are scanning all `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` files in the `./src` directory.

## Dark Mode

The `darkMode` property tells Tailwind whether to generate CSS for dark mode. In this case, we are generating CSS for both light and dark mode.

## Theme

The `theme` property is where you can customize the Tailwind theme. This includes things like colors, fonts, and breakpoints.

### Container

The `container` property allows you to configure the container element. In this case, we are centering the container and using custom breakpoints.

### Font Family

The `fontFamily` property allows you to specify the fonts that you want to use. In this case, we are using the "Poppins" and "Roboto Slab" fonts.

### Font Size

The `fontSize` property allows you to specify the font sizes that you want to use. In this case, we are using a custom set of font sizes.

### Extend

The `extend` property allows you to add custom CSS to the Tailwind theme. In this case, we are adding custom background images, colors, and box shadows.

## Plugins

The `plugins` property allows you to add plugins to Tailwind. In this case, we are not using any plugins.

## Conclusion

This file is just a starting point for customizing Tailwind CSS. You can further customize the framework to your liking by adding your own custom CSS.
